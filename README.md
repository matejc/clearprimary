# clearprimary

This program clears the primary (selection) clipboard as soon as it changes, on Wayland (XWayland) and X11. Tested on GNOME Wayland (Fedora Silberblue 34).

This is a workaround and was done because I have ThinkPad Keyboard II and it has an issue that when you scroll with middle mouse button and TrackPoint movement it just pastes from selection no matter if you move the TrackPoint or not.
